[SAP History](https://www.sap.com/about/company/history.html) 

> On April 1, 1972, five former IBM employees - Dietmar Hopp, Hasso Plattner, Claus Wellenreuther, Klaus Tschira, and Hans-Werner Hector - started the company SystemAnalyse Programmentwicklung (System Analysis Program Development). Their idea was to create standard enterprise software that integrated all business processes and enabled data processing in real time.

> The name is an initialism of the company’s original German name: Systemanalyse Programmentwicklung, which translates to System Analysis Program Development. Today the company’s legal corporate name is SAP SE — SE stands for societas Europaea, a public company registered in accordance with the European Union corporate law.

> SAP helps companies and organizations of all sizes and industries run their businesses profitably, adapt continuously, and grow sustainably.

## Landscape

SAP operates in the Software and IT Services Industry. This industry comprises various services and products that help organizations manage and optimize their information and business processes. The broader IT services market includes managed services, security services, data management, and cloud computing. 

SAP offers AI software solutions to the **Accounting and Finance Industries**. This includes analyzing large volumes of accounts receivable data in determining working capital, enriching planning modes with historical data from source systems to enable fast decision making, simplifying the complexities of predictive analytics, making the financial close more efficient, automating tax compliance, and policy audits.

### Accounting and Finance Industry Trends
1. **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** - Automation can be achieved through software like robotic process automation (RPA), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) bots to complete repetitive tasks quickly and accurately. It can even play a role in analyzing documents and preparing reports. Not only will this save your firm time and money, but it will also free up employees' time so they can focus on higher impact and higher-value activities. [@Yanchycki (2024)](https://contentsnare.com/top-accounting-trends/)
2. **Blockchain in Accounting** - For years, blockchain technology has been synonymous with cryptocurrencies. Regardless of how you view crypto, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize how businesses document transactions and preserve records. It offers better security, transparency, and efficiency than any other digital recordkeeping solution and is something you should explore to boost the trustworthiness of financial reports. [@Controllers Council (2023)](https://controllerscouncil.org/top-12-accounting-trends-in-2024-navigating-the-future-of-finance/)
3. **Cloud Computing** - Cloud computing has become the backbone of modern accounting systems. Its flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness make it an ideal choice for your business, regardless of size. Going full-cloud allows you to access data from anywhere and in real-time, ensuring you have up-to-the-minute insights. [@Controllers Council (2023)](https://controllerscouncil.org/top-12-accounting-trends-in-2024-navigating-the-future-of-finance/) 
4. **Cybersecurity and Data Privacy** - As more data is shared electronically between accounting firms and their clients, hackers are also stepping up their games. Accounting firms need to protect themselves from cyber threats and other data security issues, including offering adequate cybersecurity training to their employees. [@Yanchycki (2024)](https://contentsnare.com/top-accounting-trends/) 
5. **Data Analytics** - Data analytics help identify operational inefficiencies and manage risks better. More businesses will invest in data analysis to help with data-backed decisions. Accounting firms can analyze their client's historical performance data to create forecasts for the future. Forecasts allow companies to plan, so they can make more informed decisions when it comes time for critical business choices. [@Yanchycki (2024)](https://contentsnare.com/top-accounting-trends/) 
6. **Big Data** - Big data is a term used to describe the large volume of data organizations collect from various sources. Accounting firms need to find ways to store this data, mine it for insights, and turn it into actionable knowledge to remain competitive. [@Yanchycki (2024)](https://contentsnare.com/top-accounting-trends/)

[Based on research by Goldman Sachs, "AI could drive a 7% increase in global GDP over a ten-year period."](https://www.key4biz.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Global-Economics-Analyst_-The-Potentially-Large-Effects-of-Artificial-Intelligence-on-Economic-Growth-Briggs_Kodnani.pdf)

> SAP began embedding AI into its own application landscape in the mid-2010s, making machine learning and chatbots available in enterprise applications for the first time. SAP's primary aim and strategy has always been to leverage technology to help solve specific problems and to simplify business processes. It wants humans to stay front and center and be empowered to make informed decisions. 

> AI has a great many practical applications, and takes many forms. No single AI tool can solve every problem, and SAP clearly distinguishes which of the tools provides the best result for a given use case. Its extensive expertise and industry know-how, paired with an in-depth knowledge of business processes, put SAP miles ahead of the competition: it has already integrated more than 130 AI innovations and functions into its applications. These are currently being leveraged by upwards of 24,000 customers across multiple scenarios – though users are mostly unaware that AI is helping them with their everyday tasks.

> SAP recently launched SAP Business AI that is developed using SAP’s deep process knowledge and a global pool of industry-specific data, customers using cloud applications from SAP stand to benefit from it enormously. SAP Business AI is therefore a key component of all SAP business applications in the cloud. It is designed to be a reliable partner that supports and enhances the human experience. Leveraging the new capabilities AI delivers, our customers will gain credible insights into their processes and be empowered to automate them more easily – in finance, logistics, procurement, sales, and human resources.

>“Generative artificial intelligence” has been on everyone's lips over the last year or so. It’s the next big thing in technology. SAP is currently exploring a host of use cases and ideas that leverage this new technology, with the main aim being to infuse our product portfolio with AI to make it even more powerful and valuable for customers.
