[The History of SAP](https://www.sap.com/about/company/history.html)

On April 1, 1972, five former IBM employees - Dietmar Hopp, Hasso Plattner, Claus Wellenreuther, Klaus Tschira, and Hans-Werner Hector - started the company SystemAnalyse Programmentwicklung (System Analysis Program Development). Their idea was to create standard enterprise software that integrated all business processes and enabled data processing in real time.

SAP's founders and employees worked closely with customers - often sitting side-by-side with employees in customers' offices to learn their business needs and processes.
