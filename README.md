</h2>

On April 1, 1972, five former IBM employees - Dietmar Hopp, Hasso Plattner, Claus Wellenreuther, Klaus Tschira, and Hans-Werner Hector - started the company SystemAnalyse Programmentwicklung (System Analysis Program Development). Their idea was to create standard enterprise software that integrated all business processes and enabled data processing in real time.

</h3>

The name is an initialism of the company’s original German name: Systemanalyse Programmentwicklung, which translates to System Analysis Program Development. Today the company’s legal corporate name is SAP SE — SE stands for societas Europaea, a public company registered in accordance with the European Union corporate law.

SAP helps companies and organizations of all sizes and industries run their businesses profitably, adapt continuously, and grow sustainably.
